Gabriella Lubliner [2:19 PM] 
anyone up to unit 3? i'm flat out lost with one of the boolean exercises.

Gabriella Lubliner [2:25 PM] 
i definitely solved the exercise but i'm almost certain my answer isn't the answer that was intended because i needed to use an if statement which wasn't covered. if anyone gets up to it, let me know!

Michael Dennis [6:53 PM] 
Is it just me, or is there something wrong with the 5.1.1 Quiz in the WDI-fundamentals?? The page flow seems jumbled up and the code for the first function is incomplete.

Ryan Burke [9:56 PM] 
I struggled with the Boolean exercises in 3 as well and ended up using if() statements in the HW.

----- April 17th, 2015 -----

Ben Sayeg [11:22 AM] 
I didn't have to use an if() statement in the section 3.3.2 exercises.  Conditional assignment and the last section of the 3.3.1 quiz hint at what you need to do.                                                                                    EDIT:  Gabriella spotted a major oversight of mine in the 3.3.2 exercise; I am not able to single out one falsey, in this case null, without having all falseys behave the same way (hope that makes sense) .  If anyone was able to solve it using only boolean expressions, please let us know.  Thaaaaanks (edited)

@domenica:  i'm assuming we can choose between firefox or chrome because those were the two required browsers in the installfest email. also i'm pretty sure that 'command not found' was the last thing we saw in terminal after the installation was complete, but definitely double-check with one of the mentors (professors? computer overlords?) on monday.

Commented on Kelly Stevens's file Screen Shot 2015-04-18 at 4.22.35 PM.png  
Hi, Kelly.
I was playing around with the code in your screenshot, and it looks like when you assign an array to another array (in your case line 2) those arrays are synced; change one, and the other changes also.  I'm not sure why that is(yet!).  

Anyway, to get around that, you would need to set newArray = [] on line 2, and your output from line 7 would look like this : [2][1,2,3,4,5].  Make sense?

For 4.2.1 Quiz, Question 2 - I would think the answer would be 5 per the logic exhibited in the pic above. The code block is run 5 times, not 4.

Ryan Burke [5:09 PM]
x = 5 at the turn of the 4th run of the code block, and only upon the 5th running does the first if statement evaluate to true and break the loop.

then all you need to do is press command + b whenever you wanna test the js file you have open

Hey guys, thought I'd slap together a quick spreadsheet for all our xbox live/psn/steam/whatever IDs in case anyone wants to add each other to our friends lists. Feel free to put yourself down! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_ADwK7d9Rxlfd3Ii9m26sDbqqK2hpaoBnjQKVHiDOsA/edit?usp=sharing

if you value your friendships, i'd avoid playing any MOBAs together(or at all) during the duration of the course

@bensayeg: they’re closed tomorrow i think?

Ben Sayeg [11:09 AM] 
;(

Gabriella Lubliner [11:16 AM] 
i don’t think it would be a bad idea for the group to set up a place we could meet on sundays if we were interested in meeting anyway though. i’ll brainstorm on locations that might be cool with that, in case anyone’s interested/wants to keep their saturdays free! :simple_smile:

Ben Sayeg [11:21 AM] 
@gab that would be great.  I can't find anything online about GA hours of operations - lame.

Gabriella Lubliner [11:23 AM] 
@bensayeg: that sucks! i know that today’s hours are 10-6, and i’m pretty sure sunday is closed. maybe there’s something in the emails about it? i’ll definitely try to think of something. there’s lots of libraries around and probably plenty of undervisited bars that wouldn’t mind the business.

Ben Sayeg [11:25 AM] 
yeah, we can fill in the much needed nerd demographic missing from bars lately

Ben Sayeg [11:28 AM]
@gab: hey, did you complete the checkerboard?  I'm pretty sure I know my approach now(essentially, what we did in the star wars lab except moving data into other arrays of the same array, right?), but may need to compare if/when it doesn't work.

Jeremy Bell [11:34 AM] 
i came to long island last night to visit my folks and get work done in a quiet environment, but i’ll probably be back in the city tomorrow. i’m definitely up for weekend work groups.

I just wanted to make sure you're all aware that you're not allowed to eat the food until the signs that say "Enterprise only" have been removed. This is also the same for any food that is out for any other events / classes / etc. Once signs are removed you can eat! I trust that you'll all understand this and respect it.

@group Hi again.  Still haven’t found my macbook charger.  If you accidentally picked it up last night, please let me know.  Thanks!

Gabriella Lubliner [9:03 AM] 
@bensayeg: do you know what watt it was/can you describe what it looked like? i don’t think i picked it up but it specs might make it easier to find

Ben Sayeg [9:05 AM] 
@gab I’m pretty sure its the 85W mag2 for the powermac - smaller than previous models.  Purchased Last summer.  Has a green GA name tag - name might have rubbed off though.  THANKS!

Anya Glowa-Kollisch [9:10 AM]

hey y’all, hw feedback is coming, and is going to be more timely as we progress. we will be going through each assignment and will provide guidance as needed. something to keep in mind is that our advice isn’t an attack on your code or abilities (you are not your code), and we’re just trying to encourage best practices. If there’s feedback you’re not sure about or would like us to clarify feel free to ask outside of class or during 1 on 1’s.

Today’s learning objectives

Jaden Carver [10:56 AM] 
- Introduce `window.addEventListener('load', [function])`
- Create HTML input fields
- Get and set the value of an input field in JS
- Use the CSS `overflow` property to fix floats and margin
- Use the CSS `overflow` property to create scroll-able areas
- Use `for(.. of ..)` to iterate over object properties
- Use `switch` in place of complex `if/else if/else` blocks
- Use objects to store key/values for easy lookup

Dennis Liaw [11:07 AM] 
if submit_hw isn’t working for you we’ll sort it out after the lesson

Robert King [11:15 AM] 
@jadencarver: does creating a variable in the scope of an anonymous function for something that will be used as often as an event listener allocate memory for that function every time it is called and therefore wasting memory, or does it rewrite the existing placeholder in memory every time it is called?

Robert King [11:16 AM]
@jadencarver: meant to type variable* instead of function that second time

Dennis Liaw [11:22 AM] 
@bobbydigital: nope. just once, which is why it’s awesome

Dennis Liaw [11:22 AM]
oh wait

Dennis Liaw [11:22 AM]
the function gets made once

Dennis Liaw [11:23 AM]
but once it’s called, the variables inside get made

Dennis Liaw [11:23 AM]
and they are separate from other instances of that function

Dennis Liaw [11:24 AM]
if that variable was global though. you’d overwrite. so dont forget the `var`

Robert King [11:25 AM] 
@dennisliaw: gotcha, so  that variable lives and dies within the scope of the function so there is no wasting of memory, right?

Dennis Liaw [11:26 AM] 
yeah and when it’s done the garbage collector will axe it

Jaden Carver [12:03 PM]

@group ok one more time, lets run `gem update submit_hw` and upgrade to 0.1.8 and try to submit_hw again

Dennis Liaw [1:42 PM] 
let me know asap if it breaks

Max Peterson [1:45 PM] 
@dennisliaw: Anya already responded to my HW pull request, should I still run submit_hw again after updating?

Jaden Carver [2:17 PM]

I apologize class for trying to use `Modernizr.load`. The documentation on their website is wrong, and I misread this notice:
> For these reasons, we're also **not** going to include yepnope in the next version of Modernizr as Modernizr.load.
It appears to be fundamentally broken - so the way we implemented it loading the script manually is the new “correct" way.

It’s no fun when things that you have used for years are torn out from under you, but this is life as a developer (edited)

@group hey guys! Hope you’re having a good time with the sprint.
We’re going to regroup at 4:30 today to:
- get a temperature check
- send out the exit tickets
- go over our agenda for tomorrow

Phil Lamplugh [2:30 PM] 
@group people have asked about help and we love helping. however, during projects we want you guys to have some independence. So we have a Pairing schedule. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GXHNsWZAKNJFkbXl9PfeG5FyVnDco2yJWNddxk5r3HA/edit?usp=sharing

If you have a specific code problem and you’ve already searched the docs and any previous code examples we’ve done but still need help, you can ping us for a slot.

There are enough spaces to allot everyone up to two sessions.

- They can’t be consecutive or with the same instructor
- You’ll need to include a link to your code on github when you ping us for a requested slot.
- Be prepared to show your code, any relevant documentation
- Explain the steps you went through on your own to solve the problem
- State what the intended outcome of your code should be

@group we should have mentioned this before, but  please direct message the person you’d like a time slot with, instead of the main slack channel. also, in the direct message, include the link to the specific piece of code on github that is troubling you. thanks!

Phil Lamplugh [5:33 PM] 
@group If anyone is having issues with setTimeouts and setIntervals in loops try out the following:

Phil Lamplugh [5:33 PM]
```// What will this console.log?

// Think first.

// Then run it. 

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
    window.setTimeout(function(){
      console.log(numbers[i]);
    }, (i * 1000))
}

// What did it log?

// What is the value of i?

// When  is setTimeout running and what is it referencing?
```

Phil Lamplugh [5:38 PM] 
Compare that to this
```    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        (function(n){
            window.setTimeout(function(){
                console.log(numbers[n])
            }, (n * 1000))
        })(i)
    }
```

Dennis Liaw [12:50 PM] 
to reiterate. you’re building a Person class based on external specifications

Michael Dennis [2:41 PM] 
@ group There is a syntax error in assertions.rb at line 43. It should read

Michael Dennis [2:41 PM]
``` assert_that("adding an interest adds a memory", p1.memories.include?({age: 4, memory: "got interested in crayons"}), true) ```

Michael Dennis [2:42 PM]
basically adds
```,true) ```
to the end of that line

Michael Dennis [2:51 PM] 
@dennisliaw: There are several more syntax errors in the last section of assertions.rb

Dennis Liaw [3:11 PM] 
got a line nimber?

Dennis Liaw [3:12 PM]
@michaelsdennis4: ^

Michael Dennis [3:12 PM] 
51 and 54

Michael Dennis [3:12 PM]
@dennisliaw:  51 and 54

Dennis Liaw [3:14 PM] 
ok (edited)

Dennis Liaw [3:15 PM]
~ line 44 we’re missing a closing parenthesis 
```assert_that("adding an interest adds a memory", p1.memories.include?({age: 4, memory: "got interested in crayons"}) )
```

Michael Dennis [3:16 PM] 
not just the paren, also
``` , true ) ```

Dennis Liaw [3:18 PM] 
line 52, dropped inner parens
```assert_that("a Schoolable module is added at 4", m1.included_modules.include?(Schoolable, true) )
```

Michael Dennis [3:19 PM] 
also, it appears included_modules is a class method, and doesn’t work on the instance. i.e should be Male.included_modules

Dennis Liaw [3:22 PM] 
included_modules is actually a ruby method

Dennis Liaw [3:23 PM]
that all objects get

Dennis Liaw [3:23 PM]
i’m looking into the error on line 55

Michael Dennis [3:25 PM] 
It’s a ruby method yes, but I can only get it to work on the class, not the instance. ie.it works on Male but not m1

Dennis Liaw [3:26 PM] 
```54: assert_that( "a person's learned abilities are stored in memory", m1.memories.include?({age: 4, memory: "learned how to read" }) )
```

Dennis Liaw [3:27 PM]
so part of this assignment was originally to figure out how to fix the tests as well

Dennis Liaw [3:28 PM]
but this is a freebie for now

Dennis Liaw [3:28 PM]
you bring up an interesting point in why `included_modules` doesn’t work. think about what you need to find to get the value you want

Dennis Liaw [3:29 PM]
if there isn’t one, can you write one?

Dennis Liaw [3:32 PM]
@group
```~ line 44 we’re missing a closing parenthesis 
assert_that("adding an interest adds a memory", p1.memories.include?({age: 4, memory: "got interested in crayons”}), true )

line 52, dropped inner parens
assert_that("a Schoolable module is added at 4", m1.included_modules.include?(Schoolable), true )

line 54: assert_that( "a person's learned abilities are stored in memory", m1.memories.include?({age: 4, memory: "learned how to read" }), true )

```
(edited)

Dennis Liaw [3:32 PM]
above are some fixes to `assertion.rb`

Gabriella Lubliner [3:33 PM] 
are we supposed to be defining a functions responds_to?

Gabriella Lubliner [3:33 PM]
or are we supposed to put in respond_to?

PJ Hughes [3:34 PM] 
@gab: all Ruby objects, by default, have that method on them

PJ Hughes [3:34 PM]
so no you don’t write it

Gabriella Lubliner [3:35 PM] 
ok

PJ Hughes [3:35 PM] 
if an object has a method with the symbol’s name, then it responds true, eg: (edited)

PJ Hughes [3:36 PM]
if `object.talk()` doesn’t raise a NoMethodError

PJ Hughes [3:36 PM]
then `object.responds_to?(:talk) == true` (edited)

Dennis Liaw [3:44 PM] 
@group btw i edited the correction up top line 54, the hash key is memories: i wrote memory

Dennis Liaw [4:02 PM] 
ok final corrections are in for these tests

Dennis Liaw [4:40 PM] 
@group Ok class. To reiterate on the lab, we are running a file called `assessment.rb` that tests the behavior of several classes you have to write. In it we’re using the `SimpleAssert` module to test profile behavior for these yet to be completed classes so that they adhere to the behaviors specified in the tests. These tests enforce predictable behaviors and can help you keep the code operational even after years of changes. As we’ve seen, sometimes the tests themselves need work, but it’s good to orient yourselves and pick up context from surrounding code. Did a call of `assert_that` throw an error? Look into the `SimpleAssert` module and track it’s behavior to figure out why. In general editing tests is a last resort but it does happen(re check the corrections above), since behaviors and problems can shift over time. Finish the rest of the tests over this weekend, and if you’re done, finish the text module examples that Phil was running through during the day! Have a great Memorial Day Weekend! (edited)

----- May 24th, 2015 -----

Gordon DuGan [11:47 AM] 
so how are we supposed to know which part of the tests we can edit to get the assertions to work and which parts we have to edit our code for?

Dennis Liaw [3:46 PM] 
@gordon_d: so if you get an argument error or syntax error. look around the line number it gives you

Dennis Liaw [3:46 PM]
if that happens to fall within a `assert_that` call, try to figure out why

Dennis Liaw [3:47 PM]
you can gain context by the code around it. ask what the test is testing for, and try to work from there to fix the errors

Dennis Liaw [3:48 PM]
if you’re confused as to how `assert_that` works, the code for it is in the `SimpleAssert` file. and while it looks intimidating, is not too hard to follow. look at the method, its inputs, and outputs

@group have a great weekend gang. continue working on the momentum app!

One thing to look out for, remember instance variables, unlike regular local variables
can be referenced before being assigned. They'll just return "nil"

```html
<!-- views/dashboard.erb -->
<p>Hi <%= @name %>!</p>
```

So if you have two route handlers that both use the same .erb file and you don't
assign any instance variables in the route handler, the view will still render
but the variable will be nil.

```ruby
# app.rb
    get('/') do
      @name = "Frank"
      render :dashboard  # Hi Frank!
    end
    
    get('/profile') do
      render :dashboard # Hi !
    end
```

Line 4 will not return ‘test’ because @name is not referring to @name from line 2, which exists on the *Class* Bob, but it doesn’t exist on an *Instance* of Bob.  The method on line 6 WILL work, because `def self.name` defines a method on the *Class* Bob.  An instance of a Class is NOT the same as a Class (which is an instance of the Class class) (edited)

@group the only ruby things in your views should be instance variables. keep all your DB queries etc in your app.rb.

Phil Lamplugh [5:20 PM] 
#lifetips :thumbsup:

Rather than mixing your global variables and DB calls in your views
```<!-- students.erb -->
<ul>
<% @students = $db.exec("SELECT * FROM STUDENTS").each do |student| %>
  <li><%= student['name'] %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
```

Clean it up! Only expose data via @instance_variables in your views.
First assign them in your route handlers
```rb
# server.rb
get('/students') do
  @students = $db.exec("SELECT * FROM STUDENTS")
end
```

Then just put @instance_variables in the views

```html
<!-- students.erb -->
<ul>
<% @students.each do |student| %>
  <li><%= student['name'] %></li>
<% end %>
</ul>
```

Dennis Liaw [6:07 PM] 
@group HEY YOUS GUYS, i accidentally erased the route in the readme for part 2. You’re handling requests for `/students/:id`

Dennis Liaw [6:07 PM]
the README.md has been edited and pushed

Dennis Liaw [6:07 PM]
pull at will

Phil Lamplugh [6:51 PM] 
Remember when you’re mixing Squids and Flounders in your ERBs and mixing in HTML. 
```<a href="/students/1">Dumbledor</a>
```
It’s all a string. Don't let the syntax highlighting fool you! 
We can replace any part of the string with ERB.
```<a href="/students/REPLACE_WITH_ERB">REPLACE_WITH_ERB</a>
```
It gets confusing with double quotes and brackets, but remember it
all resolves back to strings
```<a href="/students/<%= student['id'] %>"><%= student['fname'] %></a>
```

Phil Lamplugh [6:58 PM] 
Remember inputs have a type attribute, a name attribute and an optional value attribute.
You can hard code a value, or the browser picks it up from user input.


```<input type="text" name="user">
<!--
  no value set, if we submit a form the params will be `{user: "whatever user typed in"}`
-->
```

If you hard code in a value it will be set in params
```<input type="text" name="user" value="gary">
<!--
  no value set, if we submit a form the params will be `{user: "gary"}`
-->
```

If we specify the type as `hidden` we won't see the input field rendered,
but it the data will still be in params
```<input type="hidden" name="user" value="elaine">
<--
  user can't see input field, but params will include `{user: "elaine"}`
-->
```

When we use the method override hack, we're just including some additional
hidden data in our params
```<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="POST">
<--
  This will include `{_method: 'POST'}`
-->
```

```# Working with the OMDB API

We're going to practice making AJAX calls to an API.

Step 0.
- Create a new Sinatra App and render an index page.
- Include jQuery

Step 1.
- Checkout http://www.omdbapi.com/
- What happens if you visit "http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=star+wars"?
- Analyze the response. What is the content type?
- Use AJAX to make a request to `http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=SOME+MOVIE`
- Hard code in a movie title
- Console.log the return

Step 2.
- Add a button on "/" that triggers the AJAX call when clicked

Step 3.
- Add a form on "/" that that accepts a movie title, then when the button is clicked
hit the OMDB API to return information on that movie.
- Console.log the return

Step 4.
- Instead of using console.log to show the return, append the movie information 
to the DOM.

Bonus
- Can you create a search box to display movie titles?
- If you click on a movie title display the movie poster 
- Take a look at https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/#include-templates
- Can you create a mustache template to create HTML to append to the DOM? 
```

I’ve never seen that :: notation before. I would have tried it as such:

```{{#review}}
  {{title}}
  {{author.name}}
{{/review}}
```

But the error in the text makes me think that they have a .done(function) to serve the Mustache but the ajax request itself actually failed and they also have a fail/error callback also executing

Dennis Liaw [10:07 AM] 
it might not even be mustache

@group Is anyone else having problems getting ajax to work with rails?

Phil Lamplugh [11:43 AM] 
@michaelsdennis4: what error are you having?

Phil Lamplugh [11:43 AM]
I'd make sure you disable turbo links

Michael Dennis [11:45 AM] 
@phil turbo links are disabled.the correct params are being passed by ajax and the correct controller method is executing, and producing the correct json object (all verified by binding.pry) but the ajax call itself is returning an error status (500).

Michael Dennis [11:48 AM]
it’s a get method, so no authenticity token required, right?

Phil Lamplugh [12:25 PM] 
True you shouldn't need the token. Check your network tab and look at the preview response

Michael Dennis [3:44 PM] 
@philco I’m getting a template missing message in the preview! I didn’t think an ajax call required a template.

Phil Lamplugh [3:47 PM] 
It doesn't. That means rails is still trying to render an HTML page not send back json.

Phil Lamplugh [3:47 PM]
Make sure you're doing render :json

Michael Dennis [3:51 PM] 
This is what I did that worked in Sinatra
```def search #ajax method
        events = Event.where({date: params[:date]})
        @events = events.to_json
    end ```

Michael Dennis [3:52 PM]
While using dataType:  ‘json’ in the ajax hash

Michael Dennis [3:53 PM]
And require ‘json’ in the controller

Michael Dennis [4:29 PM] 
I added this line to the method
```render json: @events```
and it worked.

Node is a single-threaded, single-process system which enforces shared-nothing design with OS process boundaries. It has rather good libraries for networking. I believe this to be a basis for designing very large distributed programs. The “nodes” need to be organized: given a communication protocol, told how to connect to each other. In the next couple months we are working on libraries for Node that allow these networks.

what’s the plan for Monday afternoon while some folks are meeting with Kyle?

Anya Glowa-Kollisch [2:58 PM] 
@group the videos of your sweet libs presentations are up. the videos are unlisted (to protect your privacy), so you need the correct link to see each video. I’ll email these links to you, too.

I really encourage you to watch these. They are great tools to help you better understand 7 libraries/frameworks/tools. Furthermore, public speaking and talking about technology are very important skills, and watching yourself do it is a great way to figure out what you can do better. That could mean reducing how often you say “like” or “um” or “you know", making more eye contact, speaking louder, speaking slower/more clearly, reducing how often you adjust your hair or stare into space, or any number of other bad habits you don’t know you have.
